			<h1>Routines FAQ</h1>
			<h2>What is a routine?</h2>
				<p>A routine is a weekly schedule that assigns a set of exercises to perform on specific days. Following a routine ensures that each muscle group isn't overworked and the proper amount of rest is taken into account.</p>
			<h2>What routines are recommended?</h2>
				<p>Here are two beginner routines used by many beginner and intermediate lifters:</p>
				<ul class="index">
					<li><a href="ST Sample Routine nSuns.html">nSuns531</a></li>
					<li><a href="ST Sample Routine PPL.html">PPL (Push Pull Leg)</a></li>
				</ul>
			<h2>What does a routine look like?</h2>
				<p>As an example, one day in a routine might look like this:</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Exercise</th>
						<th>Sets x Reps</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Bench Press</td>
						<td>5x5</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Overhead Press</td>
						<td>4x8</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Weighted Dips</td>
						<td>4x8</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Tricep Extension</td>
						<td>4x8</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>Here is some important vocabulary to take into account: Sets and Reps.</p>
				<p>Multiple reps create a set. Multiple sets create an exercise.</p>
				<p>For the notation used above, 5x5 would equate to performing 5 sets, consisting of 5 reps each, to complete an exercise. 4x8 would equate to performing 4 sets, consisting of 8 reps each.</p>
				<p>Between each set should be a brief rest period, anywhere from 30 seconds to 90 seconds.</p>
			<h2>How are routines created?</h2>
				<p>Many routines are created through two principles: Rest and Balance.</p> 
				<p>Rest is the amount of recovery time given to each muscle group. Exercises with heavy weight or high volume will require more recovery time so the muscles can build properly.</p> 
				<p>Balance ties into this concept in that the user want to ensure that every muscle group is targeted. Often, routines will rotate, each day, between muscle groups to ensure that each muscle group has an equal amount of rest and work without overloading the body all at once.</p>
