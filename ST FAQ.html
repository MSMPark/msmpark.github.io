			<h1>Strength Training FAQ</h1>
			<h2>What is Strength Training?</h2>
				<p>Regardless of body type, strength can be trained in any person. Through the repeated physical straining of muscle groups the body adapts, rebuilds, and strengthens itself over time. This strain can be induced in a number of ways; this website will focus on weight-lifting as the preferred method.</p>
			<h2>Why train for strength?</h2>
				<p>The initial health benefits that come with increased muscle mass and bone density carry over to the long term. Elderly individuals who continue to do resistance training have less joint issues compared to their contemporaries and middle-aged individuals have a much easier time preserving muscle mass despite the deterioration that comes with age.</p>
				<p>Performance in other areas also increases. Many athletes integrate strength training into their routines to develop their anaerobic capabilities. Mental facilities also improve with strength training, similar to the improvement from other types of exercise.</p>
			<h2>How do I start?</h2>
				<p>Begin by researching different exercises and discovering how they target different muscle groups. You can go through the <a href="ST Exercise Index.html">Exercise Index</a> and read through all the exercises to get an idea. Specific movements train specific muscles, and being mindful in utilizing the intended muscles during said movements will develop strength accordingly.</p>
				<p>Once this base of knowledge is learned, the trainee can create a <a href="ST Routines FAQ.html">routine</a> to fit their specific needs. These routines are schedules that balance exercise and rest-- allowing each muscle group a few days to rest prevents injury and allows for greater muscle growth.</p>
			<h2>What sort of exercises build strength?</h2>
				<p>Generally, the following two categories of exercises are considered: <a href="ST Exercise Index.html">main lifts</a>, <a href="ST Exercise Index.html">accessory lifts</a>.</p>
				<p>Main lifts are compound exercises, meaning they work multiple muscles at the same time. They often have strict form in order to provide a safe base of support to perform the exercise, and if not performed correctly, can lead to injury. They are often performed with heavy weight and low volume.</p> 
				<p>Accessory lifts are isolation exercises, meaning they work very few muscles at a time, usually one or two. They target smaller muscles that often don't get as much focus compared to main lifts, and can be used to strengthen the stabilizing muscles in main lifts. They are often performed with light or moderate weight and high volume.</p>
			<h2>What about previous injuries?</h2>
				<p>While it isn't recommended to train with an existing injury of any kind, unless it's physical therapy, there are ways to still work the intended muscle groups without putting strain on the injured body part. Many of the exercises have variations that involve different stabilizing muscles that take the load off of common areas of injury like the neck, lower back, or shoulders.</p>
